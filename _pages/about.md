I am Jinghan Jia, a third-year Ph.D. student affiliated with the [OPTML Group](https://www.optml-group.com/) at Michigan State University, guided by Prof. [Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/). My research is committed to advancing the trustworthiness and operational efficiency of AI systems through cutting-edge optimization strategies and machine learning techniques. My areas of focus include:

1. **Machine Unlearning and AI Alignment**: My research targets the development of methodologies to align generative AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models, with human ethical standards. This involves not only aligning behaviors with human values but also enhancing the capacity for selective data removal from trained models. I am particularly interested in extending machine unlearning processes to conventional computer vision tasks, reinforcing privacy and control over data.
2. **Adversarial Robustness**: I am dedicated to bolstering the resilience of generative AI systems against adversarial attacks, commonly referred to as "Jailbreaking". My work ensures that these systems maintain reliability and performance integrity under diverse and challenging scenarios.
3. **AI for Code**: I leverage AI to fortify robustness in programming, software development, and code understanding.
4. **Gradient-Free Optimization**: I explore alternative optimization techniques that bypass the reliance on traditional gradient methods, aiming to decrease memory usage and computational costs, thereby facilitating more efficient and scalable AI solutions.

My research strives to produce AI innovations that are not only effective but are also reliable and adhere to ethical guidelines.
